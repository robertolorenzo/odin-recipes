    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>This Mexican flan had a lovely orange flavor. It is easy to make and always enjoyed by my friends and family!</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon water</li>
        <li>5 large egg yolks, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons fresh orange juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated orange zest</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
     <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Fill a baking dish half way with hot water for the water bath. </li>
     <li>Heat sugar and water in a heavy-based saucepan over medium-low heat; constantly swirl the sugar mixture in the pan until sugar dissolves and turns into a golden-brown caramel syrup, about 10 minutes. Watch carefully, as sugar burns easily. Pour melted caramel into a shallow baking dish and gently tilt dish to coat the bottom with caramel. </li>
     <li>Mix egg yolks, condensed milk, evaporated milk, orange juice, and orange zest in a large oven-safe bowl; gently pour custard over caramel in baking dish. Cover the flan with foil to prevent a skin forming on top, if you like. </li>
     <li>Set bowl into the water bath and bake in the preheated oven until until flan has set but still jiggles slightly when moved, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Allow flan to cool to room temperature, then remove foil, and place flan in the fridge to chill, about 2 hours. </li>
     <li>Run a knife around the edges of the flan to loosen from dish; turn flan onto a rimmed serving plate to release custard and let caramel sauce flow over the flan. </li>
    
    </ol>
